# ***Bl@ck Edition Soundpack***

⛓████████⛓████████⛓████████⛓████████⛓████████⛓████████⛓

Starting out as a personal project to merge a few basic sounds from ChestHole with @'s soundpacks, the pack has grown over the years to include peices of CC's soundpack (along with it's CO.AG tracks), additional effects/sounds, rebalancing, and much more. 

It is, to the best of my knowledge, the most complete soundpack available!

Suggestions and feedback welcome.

## Summary

The original purpose of this soundpack was to merge the ChestHole and @ soundpacks while also taking advantages of the new soundhooks that were added into the game, at that time.
Later it became a way to keep the @'s soundpack going, who in turn had kept the original 2ch's soundpack going after *it* was discontinued, as well as add in more weather effects, rebalancing, weapon sounds, etc. that I found fit the game well and filled gaps that were present in these existing packs.

The choice for music was a no brainer - CO.AG does excellent work, and was balanced well by Skybreach, so this pack is the current music pack, although in the future I will likely add more, keeping to the same vein as CO.AG.

## Current & Long Term Goals 

- Rebalance feral sounds (CC's are too quiet, or mine are too loud, or both)
- Add more handgun variant sounds
- Add more small caliber rifle sounds
- Updating more heavy weapon sounds
- Locating and updating sounds from items newly added to the game, or that were otherwise missed by @

## Changes & Compositions

As the initial intention wasn't a public facing soundpack, and many of these changes were made long ago, it's fair to say this should be used as a general reference only, and may be incomplete or incorrect:

- Combined Chesthole base movement sounds along with the majority of @'s soundpack. This forms the base of the pack.
- CO.AG music added, rebalanced by Skybreach and provided in CC-soundpack
- CC soundpack used to provide updates to @'s in a few places where needed.
- Added brand new effects to ambience_and_weather
- Rebalanced sound levels of various existing effects including radio, alarms, vehicles, to name a few.
- Added a handfull of new feral sounds, and rebalanced or removed a few of the existing ones.
- Added a high caliber sound effect for Barret 50cal
- Adjusted/added Laser and Plasma sound effects.
