# Chesthole-Bl-ck-Edition

ChestHole Bl@ck Edition

A merge of ChestHole and @'s soundpacks, with sound level rebalancing, and additional environmental FX.
The overall purpose was to keep the feel of ChestHoles soundpack, while still taking advantages of all the new sound hooks the game has to offer.
Featuring a combined CO.AG soundtrack + Remastered ChestHole soundtrack, with a few new additions.

Credit goes where credit is due.
