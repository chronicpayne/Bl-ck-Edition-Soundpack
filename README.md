# ***Bl@ck Edition Soundpack***

⛓████████⛓████████⛓████████⛓████████⛓████████⛓████████⛓

Starting out as a personal project to merge sounds from ChestHole's soundpack with @'s, the compilation pack has grown over the years to include bits and peices of CC's (along w/CO.AG tracks), my own additional effects/sounds, rebalancing, and much more. 

It is, to the best of my knowledge, the most complete soundpack available!!

## Summary

The original purpose of this soundpack was to merge the base ChestHole and @ soundpacks while also taking advantages of the new soundhooks that were added into the game, around that time (2019).

Later it became a way to keep @'s soundpack updated (who in turn had kept the original 2ch's soundpack going after *it* was discontinued) with current versions of the game, as well as add in more weather effects, rebalancing, weapon sounds, etc. that I felt would fit the game and filled in gaps that were present in these existing soundpacks.

The choice for music was a no brainer - CO.AG does excellent work, and was balanced well by Skybreach - although in the future I may consider adding more, keeping to the same atmospheric vein.

## Current & Long Term Goals 

- Rebalance feral sounds (CC's are too quiet, mine are too loud, or both)
- Adding handgun variant sounds
- Adding small caliber rifle variant sounds
- Updating and adding more heavy weapon variant sounds
- Locating/adding/updating sounds from items recently added to the base game, popular mods, or that were otherwise missed by @
- Adding more music tracks that fit the vibe  (CO.AG, Kevin Macleod, etc)

## Changes & Compositions

As the initial intention here was never a public facing soundpack, and many of these changes were made years ago, it's fair to say this section should be used as a general reference only and may be incomplete or incorrect:

- Combined Chesthole base movement sounds along with the majority of @'s soundpack. This forms the base of the pack.
- CO.AG music added, rebalanced by Skybreach and provided in CC-soundpack
- CC soundpack used to provide updates to @'s in a few places where needed.
- Added brand new effects to ambience_and_weather
- Rebalanced sound levels of various existing effects including radio, alarms, vehicles, to name a few.
- Added a handfull of new feral sounds, and rebalanced or removed a few of the existing ones.
- Added a high caliber sound effect for Barret 50cal
- Adjusted/added Laser and Plasma sound effects.
